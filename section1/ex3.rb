# Q. Find something you need to calculate and write a new .rb file that does it.
# A. dog_walks.rb file created to figure out how much I walk my dog each week.

# Q. Rewrite ex3.rb to use floating point numbers so it's more accurate. 20.0 is floating point.
# A. Rewrote all numbers to include .0 at the end.
