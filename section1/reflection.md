## Section 1 Reflection

1. How did the SuperLearner Article resonate with you? What from this list do you already do? Want to start doing or do more of? Is there anything not on this list, that you would add to it?
Alt-H2 Super learners view learning as a process resonated a lot with me, I have always viewed learning as the whole destination. If you view it like that almost learning anything new can seem daunting. Viewing it this was instead makes it seem like a more manageable journey. Taking short breaks and often is something I do but I need to do more of. A lot of the time I get in a "just one more thing and I will take break" mindset and that results in me taking way too much time in between breaks. I need to be more mindful of how much time I have been working. I need to read more, it seems very important to not just read things you need to for class but expand your horizon by googling things you are curious of and want to explore more.

1. How would you print the string `"Hello World!"` to the terminal?
# p "Hellow World"

1. What character is used to indicate comments in a ruby file?
# -m

1. Explain the difference between an integer and a float?
# An integer is just a number but a float will have a decimal point somewhere indicating that the result needs to be more accurate of an answer.

1. In the space below, create a variable `animal` that holds the string `"zebra"`
# animal = "zebra"

1. How would you print the string `"zebra"` using the variable that you created above?
# p animal

1. What is interpolation? Use interpolation to print a sentence using the variable `animal`.
# Interpolation incorporates strings within strings.
# p " The #{animal} is one of most oddly camouflaged animals out there"

1. What method is used to get input from a user?
# gets.chomp

1. Name and describe two common string methods:
# 1. You can get the length of a string by using .length or .size after the string and it will print how long the string is.
# 2. You can replace characters in a string by using .gsub ("word", "word you want to replace with") after the string. It will replace all instances of the characters within the first set of " " with the character in the second set of " ".
