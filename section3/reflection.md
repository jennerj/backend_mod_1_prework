## Section 3 Reflection

1. What are two points from the Growth Mindset article and/or video that either resonated with you, or were brand new to you?
* Understanding that mistakes are essential to learning. A big part of growing up is trying not to make mistakes. Learning not only to allow them but to embrace them as a learning experience is a weird concept.  
* Exact opposite of a growth mindset is a fixed mindset. Basically the idea that you and your capabilities cannot grow.

1. In which ways do you currently demonstrate a Growth Mindset? In which ways do you _not_?
* Currently going back to school for the 3rd time and learning something new is a growth mindset. Not accepting the fact that I am done learning and can learn something new.
* Ways that I am not showing a growth mindset would be that I like working out and exercising but in a certain way. My fiance' has been doing this yoga type fitness class and wants me to join her. I am not into it because its not the traditional way I like to work out but I should still give it a try.

1. What is a Hash, and how is it different from an Array?
* A hash is a collection of key-value pairs. It is different from an array because when referencing the particular object a key in a hash can be anything. A key in a array needs to be an integer.

1. In the space below, create a Hash stored to a variable named `pet_store`.  This hash should hold an inventory of items and the number of that item that you might find at a pet store.
* pet_store = {dog_food: 35, dog_treats: 250, dog_bones: 57}

1. Given the following `states = {"CO" => "Colorado", "IA" => "Iowa", "OK" => "Oklahoma"}`, how would you access the value `"Iowa"`?
* puts states['IA']

1. With the same hash above, how would we get all the keys?  How about all the values?
* puts states.keys to get all the keys
* puts states.values to get all of the values

1. What is another example of when we might use a hash?  In your example, why is a hash better than an array?
* To collect data when visiting different cities which places to eat should be priority.
* In this particular example a hash would be better because a certain value might be a name of a place and hashes are better for non integer values.

1. What questions do you still have about hashes?
* Why is it called a hash?
